Write a program to find the second largest number in an array?

In a given integer array, move all the non zero numbers to top of the array.
Write a function named moveNonZeros(arr[]) that returns the converted array as output.
Use only the input array. Donâ€™t create another array
This should be solved with a single loop

Sample Input       : [6, -1, 5, 0, 4, 0, -9, 0]

Output        : [6, -1, 5, 4, -9, 0, 0, 0, 0]
