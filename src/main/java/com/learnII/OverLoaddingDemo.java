 * Created by Prem Chand on 9/22/2016.
 * overloading method must change argument list
 * return can also change but doesn't matter if remains same
 * access modifier can change or stay same not a issue but should have same list of arguemnt
 * it can throw exceptions
 * C:\MyStuff\javaCourse\2016-09-22_1628.png >> path for problem statment
 * overriding is only applicanble for constructor not overriding because overriding it between methods of super and sub class
 * and construtor  will be in that particular class
 * overloadding COMPILER decides which method to invoke
 * Overriding JVM decides which method to invoked based on object because untill runtime compiler don't knwo which method to execute because it all depends on object type
 * OVERRIDING is called >> RUNTIME POLYMORPHISM
 * OVERLOADING is called >> COMPILE TIME POLYMORPHISM
